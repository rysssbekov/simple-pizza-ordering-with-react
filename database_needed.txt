1. User Account database-----this is used to store users's account information

2. Shopping cart -----this is used to store user's current items in the shopping cart
(I think this can just be implemented with an array in local host)

3. Pizza orders database-----this is a database that stores orders that needed to be delivered from different users, once the order is
                              completed, that order in the database should be deleted.
                              
4. User Payment history-----this is a database that stores user's payment history, which includes items and paid amount of each transection
                            of a user.
(I think this can be merged into User Account database)
